    "1. **Deletion methods**: \n",
    "   - Removing rows or columns with missing data when the proportion of missingness is low.\n",

    "   - Replacing missing values with statistical estimates, such as mean, median, mode, or predictions from machine learning models.\n",

    "3. **Advanced modeling**: \n",
    "   - Using algorithms designed to handle missing data, such as multiple imputation or matrix factorization.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Flagging missingness**: \n",
    "   - Creating additional features to indicate whether a value was missing, which can add predictive value to models."
