    "\n",
    "- **Example :** Create an app that predicts rainfall. \n",
    "    - To implement it, We could use either a **traditional approach** or an **ML approach** :\n",
    "      1. **Traditional approach:**      \n",
    "            - we'd create a physics-based representation of the Earth's atmosphere and surface, computing massive amounts of fluid dynamics equations. \n",
    "\n",
    "            - This is incredibly difficult, we'll need to write code for such equations.\n",
    "\n",
    "      2. **ML approach :**\n",
    "            - we would give an ML model `enormous amounts of weather data` until the ML model eventually learned the `mathematical relationship between weather patterns` that produce differing amounts of rain. \n",
    "\n",
    "            - We would then give the model the current weather data, and it would predict the amount of rain.\n",

    "\n",
    "A dataset is characterized by **size**, **Diversity** and **Number of features**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Size\n",
    "• **Definition**: The number of records or rows. E.g. 10 million transaction records.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Features\n",
    "- **Definition**: The number of variables/columns that describe each example in your dataset.\n",
    "- **Examples**:\n",
    "  - **Weather Dataset (High Features)**: Hundreds of features including satellite imagery, cloud coverage, wind speed, humidity, pressure, temperature, UV index, precipitation history, etc.\n",
    "  - **Simple Weather Dataset (Low Features)**: Only 3-4 features like humidity, atmospheric pressure, temperature\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Diversity\n",
    "- **Definition**: The range and variety of conditions/scenarios your examples cover\n",
    "- **Real-world examples**:\n",
    "  - **Medical Dataset**: Patients from different age groups, ethnicities, genders, geographic locations, and medical conditions.\n",
    "  - **E-commerce Dataset**: Customers from various income levels, countries, shopping behaviors, and purchase seasons.\n",
    "  - **Image Recognition Dataset**: Photos taken in different lighting conditions, angles, weather, indoor/outdoor settings\n",
    "  - **Financial Dataset**: Transactions from different economic periods (bull markets, bear markets, recessions, growth periods)\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Four Dataset Types\n",
    "1. **Large and Diverse (Ideal)**:\n",
    "   - Example: 1 million customer records from 50 countries over 10 years.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Large but Not Diverse** \n",
    "   - Example: 100,000 customer records but only from urban millennials in one city\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Small but Diverse :**\n",
    "   - Example: 500 customer records representing all demographics but too few per group\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Small and Not Diverse (Worst) :**\n",
    "   - Example: 100 customer records from one demographic in one location\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Takeaways\n",
    "   - **Size ≠ Quality**: More data doesn't automatically mean better predictions\n",
    "   - **Diversity ≠ Sufficient**: Wide coverage doesn't guarantee enough examples per scenario\n",
    "   - **Balance is crucial**: Need both sufficient examples AND broad representation\n",
    "   - **Context matters**: Requirements vary by problem complexity and real-world variability\n",
    "\n",
    "## Practical Implications\n",
    "   - **Before collecting data**: Plan for both volume and variety\n",
    "   - **During analysis**: Check if your data represents the full problem space\n",
    "   - **Model deployment**: Consider if training conditions match real-world usage\n",
    "   - **Ongoing monitoring**: Track if new scenarios emerge that weren't in training data"
